sd_jqDropdown
=============

**Version:** *0.1.2*

A lightweight and simple cross browser select box replacement using jQuery.
Still *very* in beta and in need of much testing.
I will be working on this quite extensively over the coming weeks.

####Options
sd_jqDropdown allows you to choose between two display modes, ```dropDown``` or ```popUp```

To simply pass either of the above values into the mode to choose it.

```js
sdDropdown({
    mode: 'dropDown'
});
```
```js
sdDropdown({
    mode: 'popUp'
});
```

####Version History
- v0.1.2 Adds the ability to choose the mode, ```dropDown``` and ```popUp```
- v0.1.1 Adds the ability to differentiate between values and plaintext.
